/// A Maximal Exact Match (MEM) between a query and the indexed reference.
///
/// Maximality is judged **per occurrence**, as in MUMmer and BWA. A query interval `[s,e)`
/// is a MEM when at least one of its occurrences satisfies both:
/// - **left-maximal at that occurrence**: `s == 0`, the occurrence sits at a reference start,
///   or the preceding reference symbol is incompatible with `query[s-1]`;
/// - **right-maximal at that occurrence**: `e == query.len()`, the occurrence sits at a
///   reference end, or the following reference symbol is incompatible with `query[e]`.
///
/// A Super-Maximal Exact Match (SMEM) is a MEM whose query interval is not contained in that
/// of any other MEM. So [`BidirFmIndex::find_smems`] returns a subset of
/// [`BidirFmIndex::find_mems`].
///
/// Note the two constructors differ in what they count: `find_mems` reports only the maximal
/// occurrences of a match in `match_count` and `positions`, whereas for a `find_smems` result
/// every occurrence is maximal anyway, so the two coincide there.
